To make sash%cluster%program.py run at boot, follow the instructions : -
1. save sash%cluster%program.py at home folder.
2. sudo nano /etc/rc.local
3. Add commands to execute the python program, preferably using absolute referencing of the file location 
   (sudo python /home/pi/sash%cluster%program.py &). Be sure to leave the line exit 0 at the end, then save the file and exit. 
   In nano, to exit, type Ctrl-x, and then Y.

NOTE :- 
The Pi will run this program at bootup, and before other services are started. If you don’t include the ampersand and if your 
program runs continuously, the Pi will not complete its boot process. The ampersand allows the command to run in a separate 
process and continue booting with the main process running.
